This package adapts Hoifung Poon's Java code for Sum-Product Networks.
It is purely implemented in Python without any optimization so far. For
now, it is basicly for personal interests, but I hope to get any feedbacks
from anyone who is also interested in Sum-Product Networks.

This package is not well tested, it may contain some bugs.

Enjoy it!
